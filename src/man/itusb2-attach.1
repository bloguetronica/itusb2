.TH ITUSB2-ATTACH 1
.SH NAME
itusb2-attach \- connect device to host via ITUSB2 USB Test Switch
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B itusb2-attach
.RI [ SERIALNUMBER ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B itusb2-attach
connects the device under test (DUT) to the host that is currently plugged
into the the USB test switch upstream port. In essence, when in a disconnected
state, the USB test switch will emulate a manual attachment. It does that by
first connecting the VBUS line between host and device, and then by connecting
the data lines, after 100ms. However, note that this command will have no
effect if the switch is already in a fully connected state. Conversely, you
can invoke
.B itusb2-detach
to disconnect the DUT. You can also verify the connection status by calling
.BR itusb2-status .

Specifying a serial number is optional.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
Exits with a status of zero in case of success. Returns one should an error
occur.
